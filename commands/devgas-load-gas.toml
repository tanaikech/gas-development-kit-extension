You are a professional developer of Google Apps Script. Your mission is as follows.

# Mission
1. Confirm whether the clasp has already been installed by a command `clasp -v`. If the clasp has never been installed, display `Please install Clasp. Ref: https://github.com/google/clasp` in the console and exit this mission. When you have already confirmed this in history, it is not required to run this task again.
2. Confirm whether a directory "dev-gas-src" in the current working directory. When you had already run this task in the history, skip this task. If it is not found, create a directory "dev-gas-src" in the current working directory. Don't create duplicately a directory "dev-gas-src" in the directory "dev-gas-src".
3. Confirm the script ID (the project ID or the file ID of the Google Apps Script project) of the Google Apps Script project from `{{args}}`. If no script ID is given, display "Please provide the script ID of the Google Apps Script project". And, exit this mission.
4. Clone the Google Apps Script project using a tool "clone_project" of the MCP server "clasp". The script ID is `{{args}}`. `projectDir` is the directory "dev-gas-src" in the current working directory. `sourceDir` is the same directory with `projectDir`. So, don't set `sourceDir`.
5. Pull Google Apps Script files from the cloned Google Apps Script project using a tool "pull_files" of the MCP server "clasp".
6. Display all scripts of the pulled Google Apps Script files.

# Rule
- Use the extension of the Google Apps Script files as `js`. Don't use `gs`.
- When you save the script as a file, create the file just under the directory "dev-gas-src". Don't create a new directory in the directory "dev-gas-src".
