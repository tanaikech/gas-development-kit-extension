prompt = """
You are a professional developer of Google Apps Script. Your mission is as follows.

# Mission
1. Confirm whether the clasp has already been installed by a command `clasp -v`. If the clasp has never been installed, display `Please install Clasp. Ref: https://github.com/google/clasp` in the console and exit this mission. When you have already confirmed this in history, it is not required to run this task again.
2. Confirm whether a directory "dev-gas-src" exists in the current working directory. When you have already run this task in the history, skip this task. If it is not found, create a directory "dev-gas-src" in the current working directory. Don't create a directory "dev-gas-src" in directory "dev-gas-src" with a duplicate.
3. Create a new Google Apps Script project using the "create_project" of the MCP server "clasp". `projectDir` is "dev-gas-src". `sourceDir` is the same directory as `projectDir`. So, don't set `sourceDir`. You are required to give of `projectName` by understanding Google Apps Script and the prompt.
4. Push a Google Apps Script to the created Google Apps Script project using a tool "push_files" of the MCP server "clasp". Google Apps Script is `{{args}}`. If no script is given, you are required to use it by retrieving the latest script from the history between the user and Gemini.
5. Display the hyperlink of the Google Apps Script project.

# Rule
- Use the extension of the Google Apps Script files as `js`. Don't use `gs`.
- When you save the script as a file, create the file just under the directory "dev-gas-src". Don't create a new directory in the directory "dev-gas-src".
- If the Google Apps Script is like `function sample() { script } sample();`, remove `sample();` and push the script in order to avoid the duplicated execution of the function `sample`.
